                            The forest creaks and groans, mighty branches laden with frost.
                            A distant rumble carries with it the sound of danger and death. 
                            Black cloaks writhe in the whipping wind, five silent figures a dark blotch in a sea of blinding white.
                            One crouches amidst the swirling ice shards, fingers ghosting over trampled snow.
                            The trail of the monsters is clear, but faintly there is another path.

                            A clay mug sits abandoned near an ax that lies haphazardly in the snow.
                            There is still a faint warmth from it, rapidly being leached away.
                            The door sits ever so slightly ajar.

                            The black clad figure lunges.
                            A knife forms easily in their grip and bites deep into flesh.
                            The bright, cheery, sunshine-yellow of their mask is utterly impassive.
                            An alarm whistle pierces the silence, but it will be answered far too late.

                            The last dying bellows of the monsters echo through the forest.
                            Eleven monsters are strewn about.
                            A warning whistle too late as a knife streaks through the air.
                            A twelfth body joins them, knife buried in the neck of an amber-masked companion.
                            The fight is swift and brutal.
                            Soon yellow, red, and blue too join the rest on the forest floor.
                            It is not a victory today.

                            The trees begin to thin, interspersed with clusters of brambles.
                            There is a path here, narrow and well worn.
                            When the forest clears there is a house.
                            It sits small but proud, made of rough logs that seem to lean inward on each other.
                            Smoke puffs steadily from the chimney, a candleflame wavers cheerfully in the window.
                            It looks cozy.
                            Something feels off.

                            Approaching the house evidence that something is wrong becomes more apparent.
                            Carefully the group divides to investigate.
                            A clay mug sits abandoned near an ax that lies haphazardly in the snow.
                            There is still a faint warmth from it, rapidly being leached away.
                            The door sits ever so slightly ajar.
                            Someone slips inside to have a look.
                            The candleflame flickers, and dies.
                            They return with a grim countenance.
                            Light glints off something bright and yellow in the woods.
                            A black shadow crouches among the trees.
                            A second flits by at the edge of vision.

                            Something else does.
                            Black-clad figure, red mask like blood, battle-ax bites furiously into the frozen ground.
                            Suddenly the yellow masked figure lunges from the other's shadow, knife at the ready.
                            It's over quickly.
